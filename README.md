#### Current project status

    the project is still in progress as it misses some elements like validations, optimization of perfomance and the unit tests

### Estimation of the out standing work

    considering the size of the work remaining, One business day would be enough to get this project to a desired level

#### Successes
    I was able to finish the minimum required in time
    I was able to use technologies that I am good at

#### Bumps
    Time became an issue
    the way to improve is to layout a a plan of what will be needed at which level, since I seemed to spend more time on the less needed functionality
    
    I would also invest more time in understanding the problem statement as early as possible.

- This project should be designed in a way that it can be expanded into many features hence, more examples on the logic involved would be useful

additional information. The test files should be found in ./server/scripts/mockData
